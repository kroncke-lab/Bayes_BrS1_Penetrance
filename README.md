# A Bayesian method to estimate disease penetrance from genetic variant properties
Here we propose a method to estimate the penetrance of the heart arrhythmia Brugada syndrome attributable to variants in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A. All code and data used and referenced in the manuscript (not yet accepted) are included here.

## Folders
The "covariates" folder contains all the predictive covariates/variant specific features used in the regression. All other folders are the output of the
