# A Bayesian method to estimate disease penetrance from genetic variant properties
Here we propose a method to estimate the penetrance of the heart arrhythmia Brugada syndrome attributable to variants in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A. All code and data used and referenced in the manuscript (not yet accepted) are included here. An overview of the method and results are provided in "SCN5A-report.html". The R markdown file used to generate this report is "SCN5A-BrS1-penetrance-report.Rmd", which describes the methods and code used in the resulting manuscript. The raw data used are contained in "VariantSCN5A-second-revision.db" and in the "covariates" folder. The "distance_file" contains raw distances between centroid atoms in the three-dimensional structure of NaV1.5 (protein product of *SCN5A*)

## Folders
The "covariates" folder contains all the predictive covariates/variant specific features used in the regression. All other folders are the output of the
